    "# It is used to perform multiple tasks at the same time, which can be beneficial for tasks that are I/O-bound \n",

    "# - `join()`: This method blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates. \n",
    "#   It is used to ensure that a thread has completed its execution before the main thread or another thread continues.\n",
