    "# Q1. What is an API? Give an example where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one piece of software \n",
    "# to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate \n",
    "# with each other. APIs are widely used to enable integration between different systems and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "# - **Weather App:** When you use a weather application on your phone, the app communicates with a remote server \n",
    "#   via an API to retrieve weather data. The server provides the current weather data in response to the API \n",
    "#   request made by the app, which then displays it to the user."

    "# Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# **Advantages of using API:**\n",
    "# - **Interoperability:** APIs enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless \n",
    "#   of their underlying technologies or platforms.\n",
    "# - **Efficiency:** APIs allow developers to reuse existing code and functionality, reducing the time and effort \n",
    "#   needed to develop new features.\n",
    "# - **Scalability:** APIs enable services to scale easily, as they can handle a large number of requests \n",
    "#   from different clients simultaneously.\n",
    "# - **Security:** APIs can be used to control access to certain functionalities and data, ensuring that only \n",
    "#   authorized users can interact with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Disadvantages of using API:**\n",
    "# - **Complexity:** Designing and maintaining an API can be complex, especially as the number of clients \n",
    "#   and interactions increases.\n",
    "# - **Security Risks:** APIs can expose sensitive data and functionality, making them potential targets for \n",
    "#   security breaches if not properly secured.\n",
    "# - **Dependency:** Relying on third-party APIs can create dependencies, making your application vulnerable \n",
    "#   to changes or downtime in the external service.\n"

    "# Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# **REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n",
    "# - REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server \n",
    "#   communication model and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "# - REST APIs are lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate with various systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**\n",
    "# - SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. \n",
    "#   It relies on XML as its message format and typically uses HTTP or SMTP for message negotiation and transmission.\n",
    "# - SOAP is more rigid and provides more extensive security and transactional features than REST.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Shortcomings of SOAP:**\n",
    "# - **Complexity:** SOAP is more complex to implement compared to REST, due to its reliance on XML and \n",
    "#   extensive standards.\n",
    "# - **Performance:** SOAP messages are larger and more verbose, which can lead to slower performance and higher \n",
    "#   bandwidth usage.\n",
    "# - **Scalability:** Due to its complexity and overhead, SOAP is less suitable for web-based, stateless interactions \n",
    "#   that require scalability.\n"

    "# Answer:\n",
    "# **REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n",
    "# - **Protocol:** REST is an architectural style, not a protocol.\n",
    "# - **Data Format:** REST can use multiple formats like JSON, XML, HTML, and plain text, but JSON is most common.\n",
    "# - **State:** REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed \n",
