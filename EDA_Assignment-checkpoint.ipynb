    "# Question 1: What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.\n",

    "# - Mean/Median Imputation: Replacing missing values with the mean or median of the column. \n",
    "#   Advantage: Simple and easy to implement.\n",

    "#   Advantage: Accounts for relationships between features.\n",
    "#   Disadvantage: Computationally intensive.\n",
