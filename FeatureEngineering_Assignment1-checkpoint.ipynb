    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects features based on their statistical significance with the target variable.\n",
    "# It ranks features independently of the model, using criteria like correlation coefficients, chi-square test, mutual information, and variance threshold.\n",
    "# The Filter method works by evaluating each feature and assigning a score based on a statistical measure. The features are then ranked by their scores, \n",
    "# and the top-ranking features are selected for model training.\n",
    "# Example: In a classification problem, you might use the Pearson correlation coefficient to select features that are most strongly correlated with the target class.\n"

    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates feature subsets based on the model's performance rather than individual features independently.\n",
    "# The Wrapper method involves training a model on different combinations of features, using techniques like forward selection, backward elimination, or recursive feature elimination (RFE).\n",
    "# The model's performance (e.g., accuracy, precision) on a validation set is used to score the feature subsets, and the best-performing subset is selected.\n",
    "# Example: Wrapper methods are computationally expensive but often result in better feature subsets because they consider interactions between features.\n"
