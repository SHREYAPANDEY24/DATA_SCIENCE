    "# a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "# Answer: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. \n",
    "# AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and translating languages.\n",
    "# Example: A chatbot that can interact with customers and answer their queries is an example of AI.\n",

    "# b) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "# Answer: ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from \n",
