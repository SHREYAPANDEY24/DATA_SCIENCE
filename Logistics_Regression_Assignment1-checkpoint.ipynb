    "# Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of\n",
    "# a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous values and assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It predicts values that can be any real number.\n",
    "# Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification problems. It predicts probabilities that a given instance belongs to a particular class, using a logistic function (sigmoid function) to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Example Scenario:\n",
    "# Logistic Regression would be more appropriate in a scenario where we need to classify an email as either spam or not spam based on various features such as email content and sender information. The outcome is categorical (spam or not spam), making logistic regression a suitable choice.\n"

    "# Answer:\n",
    "# The cost function used in logistic regression is the **Log Loss** or **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**. It measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. The formula for the cost function is:\n",

    "# Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "# \n",

    "# Regularization in logistic regression adds a penalty term to the cost function to constrain the model's complexity and prevent overfitting. It discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# - **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds the absolute value of the coefficients to the cost function. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "# - **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds the squared value of the coefficients to the cost function. It penalizes large coefficients but does not set any coefficients to zero.\n",

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) represents the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes, with higher values indicating better performance.\n"
