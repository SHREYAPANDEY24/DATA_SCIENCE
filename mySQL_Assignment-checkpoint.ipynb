    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "# A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. \n",
    "# It allows for the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **SQL Databases:**\n",
    "# - SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use a predefined schema to structure data.\n",
    "# - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "# - Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between data are established using foreign keys.\n",
    "# - SQL databases are suitable for complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **NoSQL Databases:**\n",
    "# - NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational and can handle a wide variety of data models like document, \n",
    "#   key-value, column-family, and graph formats.\n",
    "# - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB.\n",
    "# - They are schema-less, meaning they can handle unstructured data and are more flexible.\n",
    "# - NoSQL databases are better suited for handling large volumes of distributed data and can scale horizontally more easily."
